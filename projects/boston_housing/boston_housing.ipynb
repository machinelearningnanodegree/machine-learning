In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

Percentage of lower class homeowners will decrease the MEDV because lower class neighborhoods are more likely to be correlated with higher crime rate which directly reduces the value of a home.  Ratio of students to teachers will not significantly affect the MEDV because, while education is an important decision point for many homebuyers, its influence on school performance is not so easy to quantify."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "**Answer: ** A max_depth of 3 seems to be optimal because the training and testing scores are converging on a point near 0.75, and there is not much distance between them.  Max_depth of 1 is clearly underfitting as seen by the low training score which is less than 0.5.  Max_depth of 6 seems to have a reasonable testing score that approaches 0.75, but there is more space between it and the training score near 1.0, meaning it is likely overfitting.  This problem is only more evident with a max_depth of 10.  Having more training points would not benefit the model because the scores have already converged on a value by 100 to 200 points of testing data."

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: ** When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias.  This is evident by the fact that the training score is low.  The model is not complicated enough to make accurate predictions.  When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10, the model suffers from high variance.  This is evident by the distance between the training score (~1.0) and validation score (~0.6).  The model handles the training data well, but it doesn't generalize well to the testing data and in fact performs more poorly than a model with maximum depth of 3 which has a testing score of almost 0.75."

    "* Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? \n",
    "* What intuition lead you to this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

Firstly, it is based on historical data from 1978 which is not relevant to today's real estate market.  Many factors will have changed between now and then including housing interest rates, Boston's overall economy, its population and demographics, and so on.  Furthermore, the model only has three features for predicting the MEDV which can only give us a rough approximation at best.  In reality, the valuation of a home is based on numerous factors not represented in the data such as whether the house needs repairs, the architecture of the house, the comparables for nearby houses, and so on.  Lastly, the data is highly specific to Boston and would not be accurate if used for predicting home prices in other cities where the standard of living is different."
